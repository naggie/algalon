        "At the beginning of the 21st century, Darksky Corporation had become
        the largest commercial entity in the United States. Nine out of every
        ten homes contain its products. Its political and financial influence
        is felt everywhere.  In public, it is the world's leading supplier of
        computer technology, medical products, and healthcare. Unknown, even to
        its own employees, its massive profits are generated by military
        technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry."
