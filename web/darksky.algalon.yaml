overview    : >
        "At the beginning of the 21st century, Darksky Corporation had become
        the largest commercial entity in the United States. Nine out of every
        ten homes contain its products. Its political and financial influence
        is felt everywhere.  In public, it is the world's leading supplier of
        computer technology, medical products, and healthcare. Unknown, even to
        its own employees, its massive profits are generated by military
        technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry."

# Test module instances, for static targets
# All tests must inherit from the base class which defines the minimum
# interface for running tests, results and metadata. As a minimum, name and
# module is required. Interval normally has a default, and can be chosen from:
#
#   * minutely
#   * hourly
#   * daily
#   * weekly
#   * monthly
#
#   Test widget data is organised flat, and keyed by an id generated from the
#   hash of the name, module and category.
#
#   If no category is specified, it defaults to 'Other.' If there is only one
#   category, the UI may omit categorisation.
#
#   At the moment, weighting is not applied to test failures. This is in the
#   hope that natural dependencies result in cascade failures. For example, if
#   a server goes down, it will probably take some services with it, increasing
#   the serverity of the failure; unless there is massive redundancy installed
#   by Frill.
