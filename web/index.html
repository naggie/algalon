        "At the beginning of the 21st century, Darksky Corporation had become
        the largest commercial entity in the United States. Nine out of every
        ten homes contain its products. Its political and financial influence
        is felt everywhere.  In public, it is the world's leading supplier of
        computer technology, medical products, and healthcare. Unknown, even to
        its own employees, its massive profits are generated by military
        technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry.

</p><p>
        Algalon was sent by SKYNET after RINZLER activated a planetary
        fail-safe protection, indicating possible distress on DARKSKY.

</p><p>
        Algalon's task is to analyze any systemic corruption on the VPN. If
        it's deemed beyond saving, HIVE MIND will RELEASE RINZLER to cleanse it
        of corruption, killing all currently living organisms in the process.

</p><p>
        After his defeat in ENCOM, he chose to monitor the activities of the
        mortal races of DARKSKY. His outlook on life and HIVE MIND's plans has
        been called into question, so he seeks to understand what makes DARKSKY
        so different from the countless VPNs he has observed before"
